# Hi, I'm Kheem Dharmani ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§  I'm on an academic journey pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Science at NUCES, Islamabad Campus. During my studies, I cultivated a robust foundation in machine learning techniques, statistics, and mathematics, with a particular focus on harnessing the power of NLP for cutting-edge applications.

ðŸŒ± Proficiency in various programming languages, including **Python**, is a cornerstone of my skill set. I bring extensive experience in the domains of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** to the table.

ðŸš€ My career path led me to work as an **ML Engineer**, specializing in remote work arrangements. This role allowed me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and drive innovation while tackling complex challenges in the field.

ðŸ§¬ Currently, my research endeavors are centered around pioneering a hybrid deep learning model that combines Vision Transformers and Language Models. I'm using the MIMIC CXR dataset to develop an automated radiology report generation system for lung cancer. The ultimate objective is to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of automated radiology reporting.

ðŸš€ Beyond my research, I'm a dedicated learner, staying abreast of the latest developments in AI and ML. I firmly believe in the transformative power of continuous learning in our ever-evolving field.
